# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project
 Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx dataset will be used to determine what Kickstarter outcomes were achieved based on when they launched their campaigns and what their initial fundraising goals were. 
### Purpose
Up-and-comer playwright Louise was able to earn close to her initial fundraising goal. She has asked us now to determine from our dataset of various kickstarters, how launch dates and funding goals affected their outcomes.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
